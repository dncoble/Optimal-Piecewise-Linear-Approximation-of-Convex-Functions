# Coble_2022_Piecewise_Activation_Functions

Amin et al. introduced the idea of piecewise sigmoid approximations that use slopes which are powers of two (and bitwise shifts in fixed point numbers) to accelerate performance. However I have not seen a more systematic investigation of functions of this type. This paper has three goals.
1. Show the derivation of a methodology for creating 'best' PWL functions.
2. Show the numbers for sigmoid, tanh, and arctan functions.
3. Run these functions on an FPGA.
